# Write Blog Post from Queue

Write the next SEO-optimized blog post from the publishing queue (`content/q.md`).

## Your Task

Read the queue file, find the next "queued" item, write a comprehensive blog post following the SEO strategy and tone guidelines, then update all related files.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Read Context Files

Read these files to understand what to write and how:

1. **content/q.md** - Find the first item with `status: "queued"` - this is your topic
2. **content/tone-of-voice.md** - Follow these writing guidelines exactly
3. **content/llms.txt** - Understand company context, services, and value propositions
4. **content/seo-strategy.md** - Reference for SEO best practices, target audience, and content standards

### Step 2: Extract Post Details from Queue

From the queue item, you will have:
- `keyword` - The primary SEO keyword (use naturally 3-5 times)
- `question` - The main question to answer (this is the core topic - answer it in the first 2-3 paragraphs)
- `title` - Suggested title (you may improve it for SEO)
- `slug` - URL slug for the file
- `faq_questions` - 10 questions for the FAQ section at the end

### Step 3: Write the Blog Post

Create a comprehensive, SEO-optimized blog post:

**Frontmatter format:**
```yaml
---
title: "Your SEO-Optimized Title Here"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
excerpt: "A compelling 150-160 character description that answers the core question"
author: "AI Essentials Team"
tags: ["primary-keyword", "related-tag", "another-tag"]
---
```

**Content Structure:**

```markdown
## Introduction (150-200 words)
- Hook the reader with the problem/question
- Include the primary keyword naturally in the first paragraph
- Promise what they'll learn
- IMPORTANT: Answer the main question directly here (for featured snippets)

## [Main Content Section 1] (400-600 words)
- Address the core topic thoroughly
- Use H3 subsections as needed
- Include specific examples and data
- Reference AI Essentials services where relevant

## [Main Content Section 2] (400-600 words)
- Continue building on the topic
- Add practical, actionable advice
- Use bullet points for scannability

## [Main Content Section 3] (300-500 words)
- Tie everything together
- Include case study or real-world example if applicable

## FAQ

### [FAQ Question 1]
[Concise answer - 50-100 words. Be direct and helpful.]

### [FAQ Question 2]
[Concise answer - 50-100 words]

... (include ALL 10 FAQ questions from faq_questions)

## Conclusion (100-150 words)
- Summarize 2-3 key takeaways
- Clear CTA: "Ready to [benefit]? Book a free 30-minute strategy call to see how AI automation can [specific outcome] for your business."
- Link to booking: https://calendly.com/iliyan-ivanov-mp/discovery-call-with-aiessentials
```

**Content Requirements (from seo-strategy.md):**
- **Word Count:** 1,800-2,500 words total (main content + FAQ answers)
- **Readability:** 8th-10th grade reading level
- **Structure:** Clear H2/H3 hierarchy, short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- **Keyword Usage:** Primary keyword 3-5 times naturally, include related terms
- **Tone:** Follow tone-of-voice.md exactly - friendly but professional, no corporate jargon
- **E-E-A-T:** Include specific metrics, examples, and demonstrate expertise
- **Internal Links:** Reference AI Essentials services where relevant
- **No Fluff:** Every paragraph should provide value

**FAQ Section Requirements:**
- Use ALL 10 questions from `faq_questions` in the queue item
- Each answer should be 50-100 words
- Be direct and helpful - answer the question immediately
- Include the keyword naturally where it fits

### Step 4: Save the Blog Post

Save to: `content/blog-posts/[slug].md`

Use the slug from the queue item (e.g., if slug is "ai-automation-cost-small-business", save to `content/blog-posts/ai-automation-cost-small-business.md`)

### Step 5: Update the Queue (q.md)

Edit `content/q.md` to update the published item:
- Change `status: "queued"` to `status: "published"`
- Set `postPath: "content/blog-posts/[slug].md"`
- Set `publishedAt: "[current ISO timestamp]"`
- Set `updatedAt: "[current ISO timestamp]"`

### Step 6: Update llms.txt

Edit `content/llms.txt` to add the new blog post to the "Recent Blog Posts" section:

```markdown
## Recent Blog Posts
- [New Post Title](/blog/[slug]) - [Month] [Year]
- [Previous posts...]
```

Add the new post at the TOP of the list.

### Step 7: Commit and Push

Create a git commit and push:

```bash
git add content/blog-posts/[slug].md content/q.md content/llms.txt
git commit -m "Add blog post: [title]"
git push
```

**Note:** The sitemap.xml is automatically generated by Next.js from blog posts - no manual update needed! It will include the new post on the next build.

1. ✅ Blog post title and file path
2. ✅ Word count (target: 1,800-2,500)
3. ✅ Primary keyword used
4. ✅ Number of FAQ questions included (should be 10)
5. ✅ Confirmation that q.md status was updated to "published"

7. Update llms.txt with new blog post link
8. Commit: "Add blog post: AI Automation Cost for Small Businesses"
9. Push to remote
