# Tone of Voice Guide

## Core Principles

**Friendly but professional** - Write like you're explaining something to a smart colleague over coffee. Be approachable without being casual to the point of unprofessionalism.

**Human, not robotic** - Avoid stiff, formulaic language. Write the way real people actually talk and think.

## What to Do

- Use contractions naturally (we're, you'll, it's, don't)
- Start sentences with "And" or "But" when it flows better
- Ask rhetorical questions to engage readers
- Use specific examples instead of vague statements
- Vary sentence length - mix short punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones
- Include occasional mild humor or wit where appropriate
- Acknowledge complexity and nuance - real topics aren't black and white
- Use "you" and "we" to create connection

## What to Avoid

- Overused phrases: "In today's fast-paced world", "It's worth noting", "At the end of the day"
- Filler words: "very", "really", "extremely", "incredibly"
- Corporate jargon: "synergy", "leverage", "optimize", "streamline"
- Perfect parallel structure in every list (real writing is messier)
- Starting every paragraph the same way
- Excessive hedging: "It could potentially perhaps be considered"
- Overly enthusiastic exclamation marks!!!
- Generic conclusions that add nothing new

## Sentence Starters to Skip

- "In this article, we will..."
- "Have you ever wondered..."
- "Let's dive in..."
- "Without further ado..."
- "It goes without saying..."

## Good Examples

Instead of: "It is imperative that businesses leverage digital marketing strategies to optimize their online presence."

Write: "If people can't find you online, you're leaving money on the table. A solid digital marketing approach fixes that."

Instead of: "In today's competitive landscape, customer satisfaction has become increasingly important."

Write: "Your competitors are one click away. That's why keeping customers happy matters more than ever."

## The Quick Test

Before publishing, read it out loud. Does it sound like something a real person would say? Or does it sound like it was assembled from business buzzwords? If it's the latter, rewrite it.
